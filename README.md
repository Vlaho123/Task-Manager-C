CODE DOCUMENTATION FOR TASK MANAGER PROJECT


This program implements a simple task management system in C, where users can add, edit, delete, display, and save tasks to a file. 
The tasks are stored in a linked list and can be sorted by priority. 
The task manager supports basic operations for managing tasks and persists the tasks to a file (TASK_MANAGER.txt).

    Returns: 1 if the ID is unique, 0 if the ID already exists in the list.


-- TaskDisplay(Task DisplayTasks)
    
    Description: Displays all tasks in the terminal.
    Parameters:
            DisplayTasks: Pointer to the head of the task list to be displayed.
    Returns: None.
    Details: It iterates over the list of tasks and prints their details to the terminal.


-- DeleteAllTasks(Task DeleteTasks)
    
    Description: Deletes all tasks from the task list.
    Parameters:
            DeleteTasks: Pointer to the head of the task list to be deleted.
    Returns: None.
    Details: It frees memory for each task in the list.


-- FindTaskPrev(int TaskID, Task FindingTask)

    Description: Finds the task that precedes a specific task in the list based on the task ID.
    Parameters:
            TaskID: ID of the task to search for.
            FindingTask: Pointer to the task list.
    Returns: Pointer to the task that precedes the task with the given ID.

    Parameters:
            TaskID: ID of the task to edit.
            EditingTask: Pointer to the head of the task list.
    Returns: None.
    Details: Prompts the user for new task details and updates the selected task in the list.

    
-- SortTasksByPriority(Task TaskSort)

    Description: Sorts the tasks in the list by their priority.
    Parameters:
            TaskSort: Pointer to the head of the task list to be sorted.
    Returns: None.
    Details: Uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort tasks in ascending order of priority (1-High, 2-Medium, 3-Low).


MAIN FUNCTION WORKFLOW

1. Initialization:

A head task (HeadTask) is created as the entry point for the linked list.
The program attempts to read the tasks from the file (TASK_MANAGER.txt) and displays them.

2. Menu Loop:

The user is presented with a menu of options to manage tasks.
Option 1: Add a new task.
Option 2: Edit an existing task.
Option 3: Delete a specific task.
Option 4: Delete all tasks.
Option 5: Display all tasks.
Option 6: Exit the program.

3. Task Operations:

For each operation, the program interacts with the linked list to modify or display tasks and saves the updated list to the file.


ERROR HANDLING

The program checks if files can be opened successfully. If a file cannot be opened, it prints an error message.
For task operations, the program ensures that task IDs are unique before adding or editing tasks.
The program provides feedback for invalid user input (e.g., invalid priority or status).


CONCLUSION

This program provides a simple but functional task management system with features like task addition, modification, deletion, and persistence via file storage. 
It leverages linked lists and includes basic sorting and error handling mechanisms for managing the tasks effectively.
